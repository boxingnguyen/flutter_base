# base

A Flutter base.

## Used Techniques

- Flutter (3.22.2) + Riverpod + Dio

## Generate code with freezed, auto_route_generator

```[fvm] dart pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```

## Generate translated messages code

```[fvm] flutter pub run intl_utils:generate```

## Generate assets class

```fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml```

## Common rules folow dart standard

    1. Naming convention:
        - Name file using snake style
        - Name class/ variable/ function using camel style
        - Each screen is one folder with controllers, models, views and data
        - Main screen end with _page.dart
    2. Common styles:
        - Declare common constants color/ textstyle/ dimension... in app_styles.dart
        - Decalre in views/components if these styles used multiple screen in a features
        - Declare as constant in ahead of class if multiple use in one screen
        - Hard code if these styles just used only one screen

## Generate splash screen

- [flutter_native_splash](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash)
- ```[fvm] flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create```

## Test and get coverage

```sh coverage.sh```
